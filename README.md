# deformable-convolution-network-DCN-for-head-and-neck-tumor-segmentation
3D deformable convolution network(DCN) for head and neck tumor segmentation

Code for ESTRO21 hight poster : 
```End-to-end head & neck tumor auto-segmentation using CT/PET and MRI without deformable registration```

The experiments was conducted using 'nnUNet' as a training pipeline and baseline. Please install nnUNet first and copy the DCN codes shared in this repo to nnUNet.
